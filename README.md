# I-m-Sick-of-Food

I'm Sick of Food is an Alexa skill programmed by Lucas Puskaric.

The basic idea of the skill is that you prompt Alexa to give you a type of food to eat. This returns a broad category of food you should get.

For example, saying "Alexa, ask I'm sick of food what I should eat" will randomly choose a category of food to eat.

Future updates will include suggestions of where to eat.
